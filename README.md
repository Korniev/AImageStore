# AImageStore
AImageStore is a Django-based web application that simplifies the process of image recognition,
sorting, and storage. The project leverages a pre-trained neural network model to efficiently classify
images, specifically identifying animals in uploaded images. It also integrates with Google Drive,
allowing users to save and organize their classified images directly in their Drive. The application
features user authentication through Google, language switching (supporting English, Ukrainian, and
Spanish) and a chatbot powered by the OpenAI API was implemented.
